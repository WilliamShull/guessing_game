This game takes the users weight to calculate what they would weigh if they were on the moon.

Alex's notes:

We changed the formatting a little bit and then we decided to added the options to see how much the user weighs
on Mercury, Mars, Venus, Jupiter or the Moon. Then we created a switch statement instead of multiple if/else
statements.
